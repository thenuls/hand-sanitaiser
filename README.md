ABOUT THIS PROJECT
In this current situation of global pandemic, it is advised by World Health Organization to keep hands washed. Although the main problem is the way we do it, that is by physical touch, which in short doesnâ€™t serve our purpose. So we will learn how to make our own Arduino Based Soap or Hand Sanitizer Dispenser.

Supplies:
Electronics:

Arduino Nano ( or any Arduino ).
Ultrasonic Sensor ( HC-SR04)
Servo Motor ( metal Geared Preferred ).
Jumper Wires ( female to female ).
Tools:

Hot Glue Gun.
Computer or Laptop.
Misc:

Alcohol Based Hand Rub or Sanitizer.( most important)
Self Threading Screw ( 1 pcs).
0.8 mm copper wire ( 0.5 meter ).
plastic container ( which fits everything inside comfortably)
Stationary ( marker and ruler scale ).
